// This test has been disabled because it conflicts with @QuarkusIntegrationTest
// It tries to manage its own container while Quarkus is already managing one.
// 
// This type of test should be moved to a dedicated integration test module
// that uses Testcontainers directly without @QuarkusIntegrationTest.
//
// Original purpose: Test gRPC health check by starting a separate Docker container
// and verifying external connectivity (simulating how Consul would connect).
//
// For module-level integration tests, use the pattern in GrpcHealthCheckIT.java
// which uses @QuarkusIntegrationTest with dynamic port allocation.
