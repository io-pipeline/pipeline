        API Documentation: User Authentication
        
        Overview
        The User Authentication API provides secure access control for applications using JWT tokens and OAuth 2.0 flows.
        
        Authentication Flow
        1. Client requests authorization from the authorization server
        2. Authorization server authenticates the user and issues an authorization code
        3. Client exchanges the authorization code for an access token
        4. Client uses the access token to access protected resources
        
        Endpoints
        POST /auth/login - Authenticate user credentials
        POST /auth/refresh - Refresh expired access token
        POST /auth/logout - Invalidate user session
        GET /auth/profile - Retrieve authenticated user profile
        
        Request Headers
        Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
        Content-Type: application/json

        Breaking: Major Technology Breakthrough Announced
        
        SAN FRANCISCO, CA - A leading technology company announced today a significant breakthrough in quantum computing that could revolutionize data processing capabilities across industries.
        
        The new quantum processor, developed over five years of research, demonstrates unprecedented stability and error correction rates. Initial tests show performance improvements of up to 1000x over traditional computing methods for specific algorithmic tasks.
        
        "This represents a fundamental shift in how we approach complex computational problems," said Dr. Sarah Chen, lead researcher on the project. "Applications range from drug discovery and financial modeling to climate simulation and artificial intelligence."
        
        The technology is expected to enter limited commercial availability within the next two years, with broader deployment anticipated by 2027. Industry experts predict this advancement could accelerate scientific research and enable previously impossible computational tasks.
        
        Stock markets responded positively to the announcement, with technology sector indices rising 3.2% in early trading.
