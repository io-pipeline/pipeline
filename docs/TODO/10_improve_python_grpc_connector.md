## 10. Improve Python gRPC Connector Script

**Goal:** Make the Python gRPC connector script more robust, flexible, and easier to use.

### Ticket 10.1: Add Command-Line Arguments

**Title:** Feature: Add command-line arguments to the Python gRPC connector

**Description:**
The Python gRPC connector script should be configurable via command-line arguments instead of hardcoded values. This will make it easier to use in different environments and for different testing scenarios.

**Tasks:**
1.  Use the `argparse` module to add command-line arguments for:
    *   `--consul-host`: The address of the Consul server.
    *   `--engine-service`: The name of the pipestream engine service in Consul.
    *   `--num-cases`: The number of cases to send.
    *   `--input-file`: An optional path to a JSON file containing case data.
2.  Update the script to use the values from the command-line arguments instead of the hardcoded values.

### Ticket 10.2: Improve Service Discovery

**Title:** Refactor: Improve service discovery in the Python gRPC connector

**Description:**
The current service discovery mechanism in the Python gRPC connector is manual and not very robust. It should be improved to handle retries and be more resilient to failures.

**Tasks:**
1.  Use the `python-consul` library to interact with Consul in a more structured way.
2.  Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the service discovery process.
3.  Add better error handling to provide more informative messages when service discovery fails.

### Ticket 10.3: Add gRPC Connection Error Handling

**Title:** Feature: Add error handling for gRPC connections

**Description:**
The script should gracefully handle cases where it cannot connect to the gRPC server.

**Tasks:**
1.  Add a `try...except` block around the `grpc.insecure_channel` call to catch `grpc.RpcError` exceptions.
2.  When a connection error occurs, log an informative error message and exit gracefully.

### Ticket 10.4: Add Support for Reading Cases from a File

**Title:** Feature: Add support for reading case data from a file

**Description:**
To make the connector more useful for testing, it should be able to read case data from a JSON file instead of just using the hardcoded sample cases.

**Tasks:**
1.  Add a function to read a JSON file containing a list of case data objects.
2.  If the `--input-file` command-line argument is provided, the script should use this function to load the case data.
3.  If no input file is provided, the script should fall back to using the hardcoded sample cases.
