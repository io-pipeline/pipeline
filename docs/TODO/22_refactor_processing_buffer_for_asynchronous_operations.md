## 22. Refactor `ProcessingBuffer` for Asynchronous Operations

**Goal:** Refactor the `ProcessingBuffer` to be fully asynchronous and non-blocking, ensuring that it does not block the event loop and can handle backpressure correctly.

### Ticket 22.1: Convert `ProcessingBuffer` to Use Mutiny `Uni` and `Multi`

**Title:** Refactor: Convert `ProcessingBuffer` methods to return `Uni` and `Multi`

**Description:**
The `ProcessingBuffer` currently uses blocking operations to manage the buffer. This should be refactored to use Mutiny's `Uni` and `Multi` to make it fully asynchronous.

**Tasks:**
1.  Change the `add` method to return a `Uni<Void>` that completes when the item has been added to the buffer.
2.  Change the `getAvailable` method to return a `Multi<PipeStream>` that emits the items as they become available.
3.  Change the `complete` method to return a `Uni<Void>` that completes when the buffer has been marked as complete.
4.  Update the `ProcessingBufferInterceptor` to work with the new asynchronous methods.

### Ticket 22.2: Implement Asynchronous Buffer Persistence

**Title:** Feature: Implement asynchronous persistence for `ProcessingBuffer`

**Description:**
The `saveAllBuffers` method in `ProcessingBufferManager` is currently a blocking operation. This should be refactored to be fully asynchronous.

**Tasks:**
1.  Change the `saveAllBuffers` method to return a `Uni<Void>` that completes when all buffers have been persisted.
2.  The implementation should use asynchronous I/O operations to write the buffer contents to disk.
3.  Update the application shutdown logic to wait for the `saveAllBuffers` `Uni` to complete before exiting.
